- use blocks instead of lists 
- make sure we don't accidentally consider .default(None) as an error for actions that return optional values or None (see input and navigation actions)


- add selenium browser driver
- add puppeteer browser driver
- add crawlee browser driver

- create seperate pipeline for testing each driver implementation
