# ElementHandle Refinement Proposal

## Current Implementation Analysis

The current `ElementHandle` class in Silk is a basic abstraction over browser automation library elements. It provides essential methods for element interaction, but lacks several features that would make it more ergonomic and user-friendly.

### Current Limitations

1. **No Method Chaining**: Operations cannot be easily chained, making complex interactions verbose.
2. **Limited Helper Methods**: Lacks convenience methods for common operations and validations.
3. **No Element Relationship Navigation**: Missing methods to navigate DOM relationships (parent, children, siblings).
4. **Missing Selector Information**: No way to retrieve the selector that was used to find the element.
5. **Limited State Validation**: No easy ways to check element states (visible, enabled, etc.).
7. **Verbose Error Handling**: Working with the Expression library's Result handling is verbose for simple cases.

### Current Creation Process

Elements are currently created by the browser driver implementations:

1. A selector string is passed to `query_selector` or similar methods
2. The browser automation library (e.g., Playwright, Selenium) finds the element
3. The driver wraps the native element reference in an `ElementHandle` instance
4. The driver returns a `Result` containing either the `ElementHandle` or an error
